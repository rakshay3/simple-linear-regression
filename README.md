# simple-linear-regression

This repository contains solutions for four linear regression problems. Three solution uses Python and the scikit-learn library and one solution uses plotnine library to predict target variables based on input datasets.

## File Structure
- `dataset/`: Contains all datasets(csv).
- `src/`: Python scripts for each regression model.
- `requirements.txt`: List of required Python libraries.

#Metric 

Mean_Squared_Error(mse): It is a way to measure how well the prediction made by the model matches the actual values
                         A small mse value means the model is better at predicting.

RÂ² Score: It is a percentage of accuracy of the model's prediction with respect to actual values.
